I am currently a research scientist in the [Machine Learning Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt) at NIH/NIMH, where I collaborate with experimentalists across a wide range of fields to build computational models to explain neural data. My primary research interest is driven by developing models to understand computations carried out the brain. I am particularly passionate about the future of integrating end-to-end task-driven learning on neural data with both behavioral and neuronal interventions, aiming to uncover specific mechanisms and objectives in neural processings.

Prior to NIH, I received my joint PhD in [Neural Computation](http://compneuro.cmu.edu/) and [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I had the privilege of being advised by by [Mike Tarr](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/tarrlab/) and [Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/). My PhD works have focused on modeling visual and semantic processing in the human brain, where I collected data using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and used models from computer vision and natural language processing to model brain responses of viewing natural images and movies. 

Before CMU, I received a B.A. in Statistics and Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley.

Other than research, I enjoy bouldering, mountaineering, cooking, and reading.
